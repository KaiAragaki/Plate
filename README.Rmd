**gp** is a package meant to provide introduce a **g**rammar of **p**lates. Microwell plates are usually arranged in visually meaningful ways but are not tidy data, and their manipulation into a tidy form (or back) is uniquely cumbersome. This package is aimed at both developers that create packages that ingest and produce plate data as well as for interactive use.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("KaiAragaki/gp")
```
## Creating plates with gp

Creating a plate plot is simple:

```{r example, dpi=500}
library(gp)
gp(rows = 8, cols = 16) |>
  gp_plot(row)
```
We can add rectangular 'sections' to our plates:

```{r dpi=500}
gp(rows = 16, cols = 24) |> 
  gp_sec("my_section", nrow = 12, ncol = 6, start_corner = "tl", flow = "row") |> 
  gp_plot(my_section)
```

These sections can have sections as well. KAINOTE(Easier to understand example here)

```{r dpi=500}
gp(rows = 16, cols = 24) |> 
  gp_sec("my_section", nrow = 12, ncol = 6, start_corner = "tl", flow = "row") |> 
  gp_sec("secsec", nrow = 3, ncol = 3, start_corner = "tl", flow = "col") |> 
  gp_plot(secsec)
```




`gp` also has a theme - `gp_mini_theme` - that lets you create sparkline-esque plates.

```{r}
mini_plot <- gp(8, 12) |> 
  gp_sec(name = "primers", ncol = 3) |> 
  gp_plot(primers) + 
  gp_mini_theme()
ggplot2::ggsave(filename = "./man/figures/mini-plot.png", 
                plot = mini_plot,
                height = 0.5, 
                width = 0.75, 
                units = "in", 
                scale = 3.5)
```

# Vocabulary


## Axes

There are only two axes when defining plates: rows and columns

* `row`: The absolute row of the plate, starting at the **top** of the plate. This axis corresponds most closely with the physical plate.
* `col`: The absolute column of the plate, starting at the **left** of the plate. This axis corresponds most closely with the physical plate.

### Modifiers

These axes can have modifier(s) appended to their name, like:

* `sec`: section. This is the axis number of a given [section](#sections).
* `rel`: relative. This flips the axes such that the starting corner is now (1, 1)
* `par`: parent. This indicates whether the `sec` refers to the current section or the parent section.

`par` will not appear without `sec`, but `sec` can appear without `par`. Order is important. A fully loaded column will look like `row_sec_par_rel`. KAINOTE(columns where?)


## Sections

A section is a rectangular field of wells. A plate is section - the largest section. Sections can have sections of their own - these are child sections. All sections except the plate have parent sections. Sections must be - at most - the same size as their parent section. **As of writing, sections must all be the same size, but this will likely change**.

Sections can have attributes:

* `padding`
* `margin`

## Lanes

A lane is used to define a grid of sections, and is usually more than one well wide (otherwise it is just a row or column). Both lanes are only used to define sections if `wrap = FALSE`. If `wrap = TRUE`, then sections are allowed to `flow` off an edge in the specified direction (`flow = "row"` or `flow = "col"`) and continue on the next line. 

# TODO

- [x] Break Sections: Be able to specify if only 'whole integer' sections should be allowed to appear
  - wrap = TRUE needs to be put through this stuff too.
- [ ] Margin/Padding
  - Should probably JUST do margin for simplicity sake.
- [x] Real plotting functions. Also a miniplotting function for inline plotting (a la sparklines)
- [x] pkgdown
- [ ] update hex
- [ ] Allow user to supply a vector for rows/cols for  section definition
- [ ] Data layering? Need to think about how to best do this.
