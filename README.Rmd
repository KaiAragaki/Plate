**gp** is a package meant to provide introduce a **g**rammar of **p**lates. 

Microwell plates are usually arranged in visually meaningful ways but are not tidy data, and their manipulation to and from a tidy form is cumbersome. gp is aimed at both developers that create packages that ingest and produce plate data as well as for interactive operating on microwell data.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("KaiAragaki/gp")
```
## Creating plates with gp

Creating a plate plot is simple:

```{r example, dpi=500}
library(gp)
gp(rows = 16, cols = 24) |>
  gp_plot(as.factor(.row))
```
We can add rectangular 'sections' to our plates:

```{r dpi=500}
gp(rows = 16, cols = 24) |> 
  gp_sec("my_section", nrow = 12, ncol = 6) |> 
  gp_plot(as.factor(my_section))
```

These sections can have sections of their own, just by layering one `gp_sec` on the other.

```{r dpi=500}
gp(rows = 16, cols = 24) |> 
  gp_sec("my_section", nrow = 12, ncol = 6) |> 
  gp_sec("secsec", nrow = 3, ncol = 3) |> 
  gp_plot(as.factor(secsec))
```

`gp` also has a theme - `gp_mini_theme` - that lets you create sparkline-esque plates.

```{r}
mini_plot_cols <- gp(8, 12) |> 
  gp_sec(name = "primers", ncol = 3) |> 
  gp_plot(as.factor(primers)) + 
  gp_mini_theme()
ggplot2::ggsave(filename = "./man/figures/mini-plot_cols.png", 
                plot = mini_plot_cols,
                height = 0.5, 
                width = 0.75, 
                units = "in", 
                scale = 3.5)

mini_plot_rows <- gp(8, 12) |> 
  gp_sec(name = "primers", nrow = 3) |> 
  gp_plot(as.factor(primers)) + 
  gp_mini_theme()
ggplot2::ggsave(filename = "./man/figures/mini-plot_rows.png", 
                plot = mini_plot_rows,
                height = 0.5, 
                width = 0.75, 
                units = "in", 
                scale = 3.5)
```

For instance:

> You should align your primers in columns <span>![](man/figures/mini-plot_cols.png){width=75px}</span> instead of in rows <span>![](man/figures/mini-plot_rows.png){width=75px}</span>

# TODO

- [x] Break Sections: Be able to specify if only 'whole integer' sections should be allowed to appear
  - wrap = TRUE needs to be put through this stuff too.
- [x] Margin/Padding
  - Should probably JUST do margin for simplicity sake.
- [x] Real plotting functions. Also a miniplotting function for inline plotting (a la sparklines)
- [x] pkgdown
- [ ] update hex
- [ ] Allow user to supply a vector for rows/cols for section definition
- [ ] Data layering? Need to think about how to best do this.
