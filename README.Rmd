**gp** is a package meant to provide introduce a **g**rammar of **p**lates. Microwell plates are usually arranged in visually meaningful ways but are not tidy data, and their manipulation into a tidy form (or back) is uniquely cumbersome. This package is aimed at both developers that create packages that ingest and produce plate data as well as for interactive use.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("KaiAragaki/gp")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(Plate)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.

# Vocabulary


## Axes

There are only two axes when defining plates: rows and columns

* `row`: The absolute row of the plate, starting at the **top** of the plate. This axis corresponds most closely with the physical plate.
* `col`: The absolute column of the plate, starting at the **left** of the plate. This axis corresponds most closely with the physical plate.

### Modifiers

These axes can have modifier(s) appended to their name, like:

* `sec`: section. This is the axis number of a given [section](#sections).
* `rel`: relative. This flips the axes such that the starting corner is now (1, 1)
* `par`: parent. This indicates whether the `sec` refers to the current section or the parent section.

`par` will not appear without `sec`, but `sec` can appear without `par`. Order is important. A fully loaded column will look like `row_sec_par_rel`. KAINOTE(columns where?)


## Sections

A section is a rectangular field of wells. A plate is section - the largest section. Sections can have sections of their own - these are child sections. All sections except the plate have parent sections. Sections must be - at most - the same size as their parent section. **As of writing, sections must all be the same size, but this will likely change**. **Wrapping is not yet implemented**.

Sections can have attributes:

* `padding`
* `margin`
