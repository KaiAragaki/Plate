# Dataframe coercion

A data frame that looks like this:

```{r}
df <- data.frame(col_1 = 1:2, col_2 = 3:4, col_3 = 5:6, row.names = c("row_1", "row_2"))
df
```

would ideally be coerced into three layers:

```{r}
values <- as.matrix(df) |> unname()
cols <- rep(colnames(df), each = 2) |> matrix(2, 3)
rows <- rep(rownames(df), times = 3) |> matrix(2, 3)

list(values, cols, rows)
```
would ideally be named branching from the base name:

```{r}
list(leafy_greens = values, leafy_greens_colnames = cols, leafy_greens_rownames = rows)
```

# Allow conversion BACK to plate form

Should be required to have position columns so things don't get mixed up, but theoretically you should be able to plate what you just served to undo it

This would require `Plate` to have a method for data.frames. No big deal and kinda fun.

# Serve metadata with the rest of data

# Spill should allow for numeric and character vectors, not just individual
