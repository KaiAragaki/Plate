# Dataframe coercion

A data frame that looks like this:

```{r}
df <- data.frame(col_1 = 1:2, col_2 = 3:4, col_3 = 5:6, row.names = c("row_1", "row_2"))
df
```

would ideally be coerced into three layers:

```{r}
values <- as.matrix(df) |> unname()
cols <- rep(colnames(df), each = 2) |> matrix(2, 3)
rows <- rep(rownames(df), times = 3) |> matrix(2, 3)

list(values, cols, rows)
```
would ideally be named branching from the base name:

```{r}
list(leafy_greens = values, leafy_greens_colnames = cols, leafy_greens_rownames = rows)
```
